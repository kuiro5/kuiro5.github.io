Hi, I'm Josh. Welcome to my humble internet abode üè°.

**I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.** My parents owned a small, family candy business and were gracious enough to allow me to help with their ecommerce website; my first foray into entrpreneurship and "programmming."

**I studied Computer Science at Penn State University.** Through an annual [Startup Week](https://startupweek.psu.edu/), I connected with Silicon Valley founders, inspiring me to make the move out west.

**I've built and scaled products and teams from inception through exit.** I've worked alongside the good people at [Cisco](https://www.webex.com/all-new-webex.html), [Toutapp](https://www.marketo.com/software/marketo-sales-connect/), [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io/), and [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/). Category-creating products and low-ego teams are my jam.

**I enjoy building applications and infrastructure with a love for simplicity, reliability, and flexibility.** I'm a polyglot programmer that believes in choosing the right tool for the job but some recent favorites are Elixir, Python, React, and Kafka.

**I'm currently spending my days as CTO and Cofounder of [Outline](https://heyoutline.com), helping companies understand and engage with their customer communities.** We founded Outline in July 2019, and we've raised venture capital from [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com/), [TnT Ventures](http://tnt.ventures/), and a host of angel investors. 

**I spend time cycling around the Bay Area, [collecting vinyls](https://sudden-iberis-6da.notion.site/13e94733b8014bf1984e62d89de8caa6?v=b3007446c7064e8780622ef1558312f9), fermenting food, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/kuiros).** Meditation has been a big part of my life and a perpetual work in progress.

**I love meeting engineers, founders, and thoughtful, passionate people.** Shoot me an [email](/contact) if you would like to connect.
