Hi, I'm Josh.

I believe in making tools that improve the way people work and create. We spend about 1/3 of our lives building our life’s work, and creating software that plays even the smallest role in this achievement is my passion. 

I grew up in The Steel City, Pittsburgh, PA. My parents owned a local candy shop growing up. They were gracious enough to let me help them with their website; my first foray into entrepreneurship and “programming.”

I went on to study Computer Engineering and Spanish at Penn State. <more>

After graduation, I headed out west to the Bay Area to work at Cisco. I landed in an organization that was comprised of prior startup acquisitions and college graduates. We worked on the next generation of [Webex](https://www.webex.com/). I learned a lot about Silicon Valley engineering culture and developing software at scale. 

Surrendering to the startup itch, I went on to work at [ToutApp](https://a16z.com/2015/03/03/toutapp/) at the time they were 30 people and had just raised a Series B from investors like a16z. We shipped a lot of products and helped shape the now $3B sales software category.  I spent a few years leading one of the engineering teams before ultimately being acquired by Marketo.

After a year of integrating ToutApp and Marketo and launching publicly, I took a short period of time off to figure out what was next.

Deciding I wanted to downsize, I joined the founding team at DataGrail. I went on to manage the engineering team, where we implemented some of the earliest software to automate data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

I’m now spending my days as CTO and Co-founder of Outline. We believe there is so much invaluable siloed customer data, and we are building a platform to help companies utilize this data to build stronger customer relationships and make better decisions.

I’m based in San Francisco, and I spend most of my free time exploring it. I love cycling, you can usually find me on Hawk Hill most Sundays. I enjoy reading, and I’m always open to new book recommendations.
