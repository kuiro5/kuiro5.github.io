Hi, I'm Josh. Welcome to my humble internet abode.

**I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA in a small-business family.** My parents were gracious enough to allow me to help with their ecommerce website, my first foray into entrpreneurship and "programmming."

**I studied Computer Science at Penn State University.** Participating in [Startup Week](https://startupweek.psu.edu/) exposed me to the tech industry and inspired me to make the move out west.

**I've scaled products and teams from inception through exit.** I've worked alongside the good people at [Cisco](https://www.webex.com/all-new-webex.html), [Toutapp](https://www.marketo.com/software/marketo-sales-connect/), [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io/), and [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/).

**I'm currently spending my days at [Outline](https://heyoutline.com), helping companies understand and engage with their customer communities.** 

**I spend time cycling around the Bay Area, [collecting vinyls](https://sudden-iberis-6da.notion.site/13e94733b8014bf1984e62d89de8caa6?v=b3007446c7064e8780622ef1558312f9), and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/kuiros).**
