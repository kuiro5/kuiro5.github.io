## Living
Still in San Francisco!  

## Building
Working on [Outline](https://heyoutline.com), specifically on giving users a single view of a community member across platforms through the munging of many disparate data sources. I've had a lot of luck with Elixir/Phoenix, I've been meaning to write more about it.

## Reading
I've been reading a lot less this year, but I've recently found myself back in the groove and have been cycling through a few books: The Inner Game of Music, Why We Can't Wait, and The Need for Roots.

There's been a few newsletters that have become immediate reads once they land in the RSS feed: Matt Levine Money Stuff, Bookbear Express,

## Watching
A lot of Warriors basketball and Seinfeld.

## Listening
Waxahatchee St. Cloud, 

Sound Radio, Reverberation Radio, New Commute

TILclimate, All Fantasy Everything

## Learning
To wake up earlier.

The ins and outs of restoring a vintage turntable (Garrard 990b).
