## Living
Still in San Francisco!  

## Building
Working on [Outline](https://heyoutline.com), specifically on giving users a single view of a community member across platforms through the munging of many disparate data sources. I've had a lot of luck with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), I'm overdue for a post about it.

## Reading
I've been reading a lot less this year, but I've recently found myself back in the groove and have been cycling through a few books: The Inner Game of Music, Why We Can't Wait, and The Need for Roots.

## Watching
A lot of Warriors basketball and Seinfeld.

## Listening
Some albums that have been on repeatâ€”Waxahatchee *St. Cloud*, Snail Mail *Valentine*, Helado Negro *Far In*, Bill Evans *At the Village Vanguard*

Reverberation Radio, New Commute, KEXP

## Learning
To wake up earlier.

The ins and outs of restoring a vintage turntable (Garrard 990b).

Diving deeper into climate change
