## Living
Still in San Francisco

## Reading
I'm rereading Martin Kleppmann's excellent [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and associated whitepapers.

After sitting at the top of my to read list for a while, I've been really enjoying John Steinbeck's [East of Eden](https://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0670033049).

## Watching
Warriors basketball, Go Dubs!

## Listening
I've made a Spotify playlist of what I'm listening to each season for the past 8 years, here is [Winter '21](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0aOMGJFzhCNrwKgGRPuGIr?si=6bf3149bb8004854).

Some albums that I've had on repeat are Julia Jacklin _Crushing_, Sam Evian _Time to Melt_, and Roy Fuyuki _Scenery_.

## Learning
How to raise a puppy! Rach and I recently added [Bode](/photos/bode), a Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, to our family in January. We've found Zak George's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/zakgeorge/videos) and books to be a boon, and this whole experience has really underscored the importance of trust building and positive reinforcement learning. We're having a blast!
